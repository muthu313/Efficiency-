Outcomes: Complete documentation ensures easy reuse, smooth handover, and supports future development. Phase 3 of the project focuses on implementing key components designed to enhance energy efficiency and optimize AI performance. These components include model compression and pruning, efficient neural architecture search (ENAS), dynamic resource allocation, hardware-aware AI optimization, and comprehensive testing and feedback mechanisms. Techniques such as weight pruning and quantization help reduce model complexity and energy usage with minimal impact on accuracy. ENAS employs automated search strategies to develop lightweight, energy-efficient model architectures. Dynamic resource allocation uses AI to predict workloads and assign resources in real time, while hardware-aware optimization ensures AI models are aligned with the capabilities of specific hardware platforms for maximum efficiency. Real-world testing and continuous feedback loops validate the energy gains and support iterative improvement.
The phase also addresses key challenges such as high power consumption in large models, inefficient hardware utilization, and increased data center energy usage. Solutions include applying model compression and pruning, optimizing models for specific hardware, and leveraging edge computing along with dynamic resource allocation strategies. The outcomes of Phase 3 demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved processing speed, better model-hardware alignment, and effective real-world validation. Moving into Phase 4, the focus will be on further refining the AI models using the implemented optimization techniques, conducting detailed testing in both simulated and real environments, and using feedback to enhance performance while documenting findings for future advancements and knowledge transfer.

In this phase, we implemented multiple strategies to enhance the energy efficiency of AI systems while preserving performance. Model compression and pruning were applied to reduce model complexity, resulting in faster inference and lower power consumption without significant accuracy loss. Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) was used to automatically design models optimized for energy use, integrating real-time energy profiling and leveraging meta-learning for faster convergence. Dynamic resource allocation was introduced to predict and respond to workload variations, improving utilization, reducing latency, and managing thermal loads in real-time. These methods collectively enable AI systems to function more sustainably and cost-effectively, especially in edge and data center environments.

In parallel, hardware-aware AI optimization ensured models were tailored to specific hardware capabilities, including support for custom accelerators like FPGAs and neuromorphic processors, enhancing throughput and reducing energy use. Performance testing and continuous feedback loops were also established to validate efficiency gains in real-world settings and support iterative improvements. Key challenges addressed in this phase included the high energy demand of large models, inefficient hardware utilization, and growing data center power usage—tackled respectively through compression, hardware-specific optimization, and dynamic resource management. The outcomes of this phase position the project for scalable, adaptive, and sustainable AI deployment across a range of devices and applications.
